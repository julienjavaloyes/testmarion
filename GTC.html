        <h3>BEING LATE TO A COURSE</h3>
        <p>
          The teacher will wait within a maximum of 15 minutes without any contact from the student.
        </p>
        <p>If the student does not show up for the class after this time, the session fee will be fully charged. The class will not be replaced.</p>
        <p>If the teacher arrives late, the missed time will be made up in the next class.</p>
        <h3>CHANGE OF COURSE DATE</h3>
        <p>
          The student has the right to change the date of the course already established if it is done more than 48 hours before the start of the course. In this case, both parties must agree on the new date and time.
        </p>
        <h3>COURSE CANCELLATION</h3>
        <p>
          All cancellations must be reported as soon as possible. If a cancellation is made less than 48 hours before the class, the student will be charged 100% of the class fee and will not be able to get the class back. However regular cancellations (more than 2 times per month) are not accepted and Marion Lim reserves the right to not renew the lessons for the next month. If a class is cancelled by the teacher less than 48 hours before the class date, the student will be able to recover the lost class free of charge.
