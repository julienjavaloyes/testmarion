              ‘As I moved to France with a beginner level French I was looking
              for a flexible way to enhance my French language learning in my
              search for a remote on 1-1 lesson set up I found Marion. For the
              last year I’ve been following weekly classes and thanks to
              marion’s outstanding teaching capacity, well structured lessons
              and build up as well as personalised content, I have managed to
              increase my French level from A2 to B1. Marion uses a clear
              structure throughout her lessons with well prepared learning
              materials, weekly homework, assignments adapted to priority areas
              as identified during our lessons and thanks to the remote set up
              she offers the perfect learning environment for full-time workers
              such as myself. I have very much enjoyed our lessons together and
              I thank for her kindness, patience , professionalism and her
              contribution to helping me improve my French .’

              ‘I have been attending lessons with Marion for about six months
              now and the progress has been fantastic. The lessons are
              completely in French with pauses only to translate an unknown
              word, or to explain important grammatical points to make sure
              there is complete comprehension. When conversing, Marion
              references specifics about your life, such as work, family,
              locality which make practicing speaking French very natural and
              more importantly applicable. When speaking French, I never feel
              rushed to formulate my sentences and always given the chance to
              try first, before (in my case) the inevitable correction /
              grammatical explanation is given. Any unknown words or corrections
              are written down in a document that can be referenced later, which
              is great as it’s only when you start to formulate the sentences
              that you realise there’s always additional vocabulary that would
              help. Additionally, Marion mentions alternative ways of saying a
              phrase explaining which is more commonly used and why, helping to
              focus on the more important content. <br />
              Every lesson I am always greeted with a smile and Marion’s
              demeanour sets an encouraging atmosphere to try to learn. I would
              never have progressed this far without her help.’

              the lessons are well-structured, there is flexibility in the
              schedule and the learning path can be adjusted to the individual
              needs. Since starting the classes with Marion I can feel more
              comfortable speaking the French language now. Marion is always
              open to answer the questions and explain them in detail. I believe
              that by working with Marion one can improve their language
              knowledge in an efficient way.’

              has always been very encouraging with me when subjects are more
              difficult to tackle. In addition, she takes an interest in my
              personal life outside of French lessons which means I feel at ease
              during our 1-2-1s and find we have a more genuine connection.
              She’s patient, calm and visibly invested in my development of
              learning the language. My vocabulary has improved along with my
              general fluency and confidence.’
