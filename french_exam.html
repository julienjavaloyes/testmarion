          <p>I did preparation for my DELF B2 exam with Madame Lim, and I think it went really well. She followed up with specific exercises for the exam, and gave me the feedback I needed to pass my exam and improve my language skills. I found her methodology to be correct, well structured and effective. I highly recommend Madame Lim for your French as a foreign language needs!</p>

          <p>I highly recommend working with Marion to prepare for your DALF exam. When I started working with Marion, I had a B2 level in speaking, but B1 in writing. During our 8-month course, she used a personalised and structured approach, but she also motivated me and gave me constructive feedback. Thanks to the work we did together, I can now speak and write on a variety of subjects such as politics and sociology.</p>

          <p>I took the intensive DELF preparation course for 6 weeks with Marion, and it was very useful just before the exam. She knew how to adapt the sessions to the reality of the test, which really made a difference. I really enjoyed her homework - it was a good reminder to study even during busy weeks. The correction of the exercises helped me to identify my weak points. Every week, she took the time to go into each section of the DELF in more detail and explained things very clearly. She always answered our questions patiently, and you could tell she had a lot of experience.</p>
          <p>All in all, I really enjoyed this course and I'd highly recommend it if you want to be well prepared for the final stretch before the exam. Good luck to you all!</p>
